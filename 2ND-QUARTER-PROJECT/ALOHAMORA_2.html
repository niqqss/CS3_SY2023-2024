					<h5 class="pppp">Peter Pettigrew</h5>
					<p>Peter Pettigrew, in contrast to his former friends Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and James Potter, is a character 
					marked by weakness and moral shortcomings. Once a member of the close-knit group known as the Marauders, Pettigrew's 
					character is defined by a lack of courage and loyalty. His defining trait is deep-seated fear, which leads him to 
					make choices driven by self-preservation rather than bravery. Unlike his friends, who fought against injustice and 
					dark forces, Peter Pettigrew's character arc takes a darker turn. He willingly aligns himself with those who seek power 
					and dominance, abandoning the principles of loyalty and friendship that once bound the Marauders together. In the grand 
					tapestry of the 'Harry Potter' series, Peter Pettigrew stands as a cautionary figure, a character whose choices serve as 
					a stark reminder of the destructive potential of cowardice and betrayal.</p>
